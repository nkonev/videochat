# Videochat
Your open source self-hosted videoconference platform.

# Why
Today Web is ubiquitous. Most of computer's users have web browsers. 
Usually they are modern versions of either Chrome- or Firefox-based browsers.
It seems enough to make video calls. But...

Many of popular communication platforms ignore this fact. 
Typically, they force you to install their Electron-based application on your computer.
Hence, along with web browser you open their heavy application, the resource consumption grows.

Many of popular video platforms store your data on their servers, it means they actually control your data.
This increases risks of data leak, also it makes it possible for them to sell your data, 
to track your actions and watch you. 

Moreover, they can remove all your data in some moment, 
so you can lose your messages, files, discussions, contacts, customers, clients, etc...

They show you annoying or inappropriate ads, you have no option to disable it.

This project offers you a self-hosted solution, that you can incorporate into your infrastructure, 
so you will possess your data and can you apply your own security policies, 
whether to expose this service to the Internet or not, to hide it behind your corporate VPN and so on.
